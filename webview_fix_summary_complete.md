# WebView Duplicate Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
In the KingKiosk Flutter application, WebView controllers were being recreated unnecessarily every time the widget tree was rebuilt. This caused:

- Visible flickering when WebViews reloaded
- Duplicate network requests for the same URL
- Increased memory usage
- Performance degradation
- Poor user experience

The issue was identified by observing controller deallocation logs: `"FlutterWebViewController - dealloc"` appearing repeatedly when the app was running.

## Root Cause
The root cause was found in `WebViewTile.build()` method:
```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  // ...
  final webViewWidget = _stableWebViewWidget ?? _createWebView();
  // ...
}
```

Even though we created a "stable" WebView in `initState()`, the `build()` method was still potentially creating a new one. Because Flutter can destroy and recreate widgets during normal operation, this caused the WebView controllers to be repeatedly deallocated and recreated.

## Solution Implemented
The solution consisted of two key changes to prevent WebView controller recreation:

1. **In the WebViewTile widget**:
   * Used `late final` to ensure the WebView widget is only created once:
     ```dart
     late final InAppWebView _stableWebViewWidget;
     ```
   * Created a stable key that won't change throughout widget lifecycle:
     ```dart
     _stableWebViewKey = ValueKey('webview_stable_${widget.windowId ?? DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch}');
     ```
   * Created the WebView only once in `initState()`:
     ```dart
     _stableWebViewWidget = _createWebView();
     ```
   * Modified `build()` to always reuse the existing instance:
     ```dart
     final webViewWidget = _stableWebViewWidget; // Never creates a new instance
     ```
   * Added `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` to keep the widget's state alive

2. **In the TilingWindowView widget**:
   * Used consistent, persistent keys when creating WebViewTile instances:
     ```dart
     return WebViewTile(
       key: ValueKey('webview_tile_${tile.id}'),
       url: tile.url,
       refreshKey: refreshKey,
       windowId: tile.id,
     );
     ```
   * Made sure the SAME key format is used for both initial creation and updates:
     ```dart
     // Same key format used here ensures Flutter preserves the widget instance
     key: ValueKey('webview_tile_${tile.id}') 
     ```

This double-layered approach ensures that:
1. The parent widget preserves the WebViewTile itself across rebuilds
2. The WebViewTile preserves the InAppWebView instance internally

## Verification
To verify the fix, we:
1. Added logging to track WebView controller creation and deallocation
2. Created test scripts to force widget rebuilds and analyze logs
3. Confirmed that WebView controllers are no longer deallocated on widget tree rebuilds

## Benefits of the Fix
- Smoother user experience with no flickering WebViews
- Reduced network traffic by eliminating duplicate requests
- Better performance and memory usage
- More reliable WebView behavior throughout the application
- Improved application stability

## Potential Future Improvements
- Implement WebView pooling for even more efficient recycling
- Add more sophisticated lifecycle management for WebViews
- Add lazy loading techniques to improve startup performance
