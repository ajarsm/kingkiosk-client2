# AudioTile Overflow Fix

## Issue

The AudioTile component was causing overflow errors in the UI:

```
A RenderFlex overflowed by 90 pixels on the bottom.
```

This happened because:
1. The default size for audio tiles was too small (300x100)
2. The MediaKit video controls require more vertical space
3. The component wasn't adapting to different container sizes

## Solution

Several changes were implemented to fix the overflow issues:

### 1. Responsive AudioTile Implementation

- Added a `LayoutBuilder` to detect available space
- Created a compact mode for small containers:
  ```dart
  return LayoutBuilder(
    builder: (context, constraints) {
      final bool useCompactControls = constraints.maxHeight < 200;
      // Use appropriate controls based on available space
    }
  );
  ```

### 2. Custom Compact Player UI

- Implemented a custom compact audio player that:
  - Shows minimal controls when space is limited
  - Properly sizes elements to fit within constraints
  - Maintains all core functionality (play/pause, seek, time display)
  - Uses smaller padding and icon sizes

### 3. Increased Default Size

- Changed the default audio tile size from 300x100 to 350x180
  ```dart
  size: const Size(350, 180), // Increased size to prevent overflow
  ```

### 4. Window Size Constraints

- Updated minimum window size constraints to prevent resizing to problematic dimensions:
  ```dart
  final double minWidth = 250.0;
  final double minHeight = 180.0;
  ```

## Benefits

The improvements provide:
- No more overflow errors
- Better visual appearance of audio tiles
- Adaptive UI that works with different sized windows
- Consistent playback experience
- Proper time and progress display

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:
- Further customization of audio visualizations
- Different layout themes for audio players
- More compact controls for very small window sizes
