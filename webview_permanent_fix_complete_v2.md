# WebView Permanent Fix Implementation - Complete Solution

WebView tiles were being loaded twice when opened via MQTT `open_browser` commands, causing:
1. Duplicate network requests
2. Visible flickering when switching between windows
3. WebView controller deallocation and recreation

The issue was that while we had made the WebView instance stable in the WebViewTile, the WebViewTile itself was being recreated during widget tree rebuilds. This caused the stable WebView to be disposed and recreated.

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of the issue was multi-layered:

1. Initially, the InAppWebView widgets were being recreated on every widget rebuild
2. Our first fix made the InAppWebView widgets stable at the WebViewTile level with `late final InAppWebView _stableWebViewWidget`
3. However, the parent WebViewTile widgets themselves were still being recreated during MQTT commands and widget tree rebuilds
4. This caused deallocation of the entire WebViewTile and its stable WebView instance

## Complete Fix Implementation

The complete fix involved a new approach with multiple levels of stability:

1. **WebViewTileManager** - A global singleton that maintains stable instances of WebViewTile widgets
   - Prevents WebViewTiles from being recreated during widget tree rebuilds
   - Provides methods to get and remove stable WebViewTile instances

2. **TilingWindowView** modifications:
   - Uses WebViewTileManager to get stable WebViewTile instances
   - Ensures the same WebViewTile instance is used for a given window ID

3. **TilingWindowController** modifications:
   - Properly removes WebViewTiles from the WebViewTileManager when windows are closed

4. **WebViewTile internal stability** (previous fix):
   - Uses `late final InAppWebView _stableWebViewWidget` to prevent recreation of InAppWebView instances
   - Maintains a stable key for the WebView instance

## Testing and Verification

The fix was verified by:

1. Opening multiple WebView windows via MQTT commands
2. Ensuring no duplicate loading occurs when switching between windows
3. Monitoring logs for WebView controller deallocation messages
4. Confirming that WebView state (scroll position, form inputs) is maintained when windows are obscured and revealed

## Benefits

1. Reduced network traffic (no duplicate requests)
2. Improved performance (WebViews are not recreated)
3. Better user experience (no flickering when switching windows)
4. Proper resource management (WebViews are properly cleaned up when windows are closed)

## Files Modified

1. Created new file: `lib/app/modules/home/widgets/webview_tile_manager.dart`
2. Modified: `lib/app/modules/home/views/tiling_window_view.dart`
3. Modified: `lib/app/modules/home/controllers/tiling_window_controller.dart`

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing a similar approach for other tile types (Media, Audio, Image)
2. Add timeout-based cleanup for WebViewTiles that haven't been used for a long time
3. Add better error handling and recovery for WebView loading failures
