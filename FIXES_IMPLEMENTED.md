# Implemented Fixes in Flutter GetX Kiosk

## 1. Audio Tile Closing Fix
Fixed issue where audio continued playing after closing the tile. The audio player is now properly paused when the tile is closed.

## 2. Tiling Mode Improvements
Enhanced the tiling mode to properly arrange windows when toggling between floating and tiled layouts. Windows now snap to the tiling grid when switching from floating mode.

## 3. Auto-hiding Toolbar
Added an auto-hiding toolbar that:
- Shows on hover/touch and hides after 3 seconds of inactivity
- Displays a small handle at the bottom of the screen when hidden
- Provides smooth animations between states
- Works properly on both desktop and mobile devices

## 4. Dark Mode Persistence
Fixed the dark mode persistence issue by:
- Creating a central ThemeService to manage theme state application-wide
- Ensuring theme changes get propagated throughout the application
- Properly initializing the theme at app startup

## Future Improvements
- Add grid snapping for floating windows
- Add layout presets for quick tiling arrangements
- Add theme transition animations
- Implement window grouping for better organization
