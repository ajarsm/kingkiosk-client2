# Audio Service Updates

## Implementation of Looping Functionality in AudioService

The AudioService class has been updated to support audio looping capabilities. This feature enables continuous playback of audio files as requested through MQTT commands.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `playRemoteAudio` Method**: 
   - Added a new optional parameter `looping` (default: false)
   - Implemented the looping functionality using media_kit's PlaylistMode

2. **How It Works**:
   - When `looping` is set to `true`, the audio will continue to play in a loop
   - Uses media_kit's `PlaylistMode.single` for looping playback
   - Uses `PlaylistMode.none` for standard non-looping playback

### Usage:

```dart
// Playing audio once (no loop)
audioService.playRemoteAudio(url);
// or
audioService.playRemoteAudio(url, looping: false);

// Playing audio in a loop
audioService.playRemoteAudio(url, looping: true);
```

### Testing:

A test script (`test_audio_looping.dart`) has been created to verify the looping functionality:

1. Run the test script:
   ```
   flutter run -t test_audio_looping.dart
   ```

2. Use the UI buttons to test different playback modes:
   - "Play Once" - Plays the audio track one time
   - "Play Looping" - Plays the audio track in a continuous loop
   - "Stop Audio" - Stops any playback

### MQTT Integration:

The looping parameter is now properly handled when audio playback commands are received through MQTT:

```json
{
  "type": "audio",
  "url": "https://example.com/audio.mp3",
  "loop": true
}
```

When the MQTT service receives this command, it will correctly pass the looping parameter to the AudioService.
