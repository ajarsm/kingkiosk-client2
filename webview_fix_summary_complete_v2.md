# WebView Duplicate Loading Fix - Summary

## Problem

The application was experiencing duplicate loading of WebView instances when WebView tiles were created or refreshed via MQTT commands. This caused:

1. Unnecessary network requests
2. Visible flickering when switching between windows 
3. WebView controller deallocation and recreation

## Root Cause

We identified multiple layers to the problem:

1. **Initial implementation**: WebView widgets were being recreated during every widget tree rebuild
2. **First fix attempt**: We made the InAppWebView instance stable with `late final InAppWebView _stableWebViewWidget`
3. **Remaining issue**: The parent WebViewTile widgets themselves were still being recreated, causing deallocation of their stable WebView children

## Complete Solution

Our complete solution addresses all layers of the problem:

1. **WebViewTileManager**: Created a global singleton to maintain stable WebViewTile instances across UI rebuilds
   ```dart
   class WebViewTileManager {
     // Map of window IDs to stable WebViewTile widgets
     final Map<String, WebViewTile> _webViewTiles = {};
     
     // Get or create a stable WebViewTile for a window
     WebViewTile getWebViewTileFor(String windowId, String url, {int? refreshKey}) {
       // Implementation ensures the same instance is returned for the same windowId
     }
   }
   ```

2. **TilingWindowView**: Modified to use the WebViewTileManager
   ```dart
   // Before: Creating new WebViewTile instances on every build
   WebViewTile(
     key: ValueKey('webview_tile_${tile.id}'), 
     url: tile.url,
     windowId: tile.id,
   )
   
   // After: Using stable instances from the manager
   WebViewTileManager().getWebViewTileFor(
     tile.id,
     tile.url,
     refreshKey: refreshKey,
   )
   ```

3. **TilingWindowController**: Updated to clean up WebViewTiles when windows are closed
   ```dart
   // In closeTile() method:
   if (tile.type == TileType.webView) {
     WebViewTileManager().removeWebViewTile(tile.id);
   }
   ```

4. **WebViewTile internal stability** (previous fix):
   ```dart
   // Stable WebView instance that persists across WebViewTile rebuilds
   late final InAppWebView _stableWebViewWidget;
   
   // In build method, always use the same instance
   final webViewWidget = _stableWebViewWidget;
   ```

## Test Results

Testing showed:
- No more WebView controller deallocation messages in logs when switching between windows
- WebView state (scroll position, form inputs) is maintained when windows are hidden/shown
- No visible flickering when switching between WebView windows
- Proper cleanup when windows are closed

## Files Modified

1. Created: `lib/app/modules/home/widgets/webview_tile_manager.dart`
2. Modified: `lib/app/modules/home/views/tiling_window_view.dart`
3. Modified: `lib/app/modules/home/controllers/tiling_window_controller.dart`

This multi-layered approach ensures WebView instances remain stable throughout the application lifecycle, preventing unnecessary recreation and improving performance.
