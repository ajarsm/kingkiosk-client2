# WebView Permanent Fix

## Problem
The WebView implementation in the KingKiosk application was recreating WebView controllers unnecessarily when the widget tree rebuilt. This caused:
- Duplicate network requests
- Flickering when WebView reloaded
- Memory leaks
- Performance issues

## Solution
We fixed the issue by implementing a persistent WebView approach:

1. Created a stable WebView instance in the `initState()` method of the `WebViewTile` widget
2. Declared the instance as `late final` to ensure it's only created once
3. Used a stable key for the WebView widget that remains constant throughout the lifecycle
4. Always reused the same WebView instance in the `build()` method, never creating a new one
5. Used `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` to keep the WebView state alive when not visible

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes

1. **Stable WebView Instance**: 
   ```dart
   late final InAppWebView _stableWebViewWidget;
   ```

2. **Stable Key Creation**:
   ```dart
   _stableWebViewKey = ValueKey(
     'webview_stable_${widget.windowId ?? DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch}');
   ```

3. **Create WebView Once**:
   ```dart
   // In initState
   _stableWebViewWidget = _createWebView();
   ```

4. **Reuse WebView in Build**:
   ```dart
   // In build method
   final webViewWidget = _stableWebViewWidget;
   ```

5. **Widget State Preservation**:
   ```dart
   class _WebViewTileState extends State<WebViewTile>
       with AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin, WidgetsBindingObserver {
     @override
     bool get wantKeepAlive => true;
   ```

## Testing
We've verified this fix by:
1. Monitoring WebView controller creation and deallocation
2. Ensuring the same WebView instance is reused across widget rebuilds
3. Verifying that WebView controllers are not deallocated when the widget tree rebuilds

The fix successfully prevents WebView duplication and ensures a smooth, uninterrupted user experience.

## Additional Improvements
1. Optimized URL loading in `didUpdateWidget` to reuse the existing controller
2. Added comprehensive logging for debugging WebView lifecycle
3. Improved error handling and recovery for WebView errors
