# Windows Kiosk C++ Compilation Fixes Applied ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Class Redefinition Error** ✅
- **Problem**: `WindowsKioskPlugin` class was defined in both .h and .cpp files
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate class definition from .cpp file

### 2. **Missing Method Implementations** ✅
- **Problem**: Many methods were declared but not implemented
- **Fix**: Added complete implementations for all declared methods:
  - `EnableKioskMode()` / `DisableKioskMode()`
  - `HideTaskbar()` / `ShowTaskbar()`
  - `BlockKeyboardShortcuts()` / `UnblockKeyboardShortcuts()`
  - `DisableTaskManager()` / `EnableTaskManager()`
  - `EnableProcessMonitoring()` / `DisableProcessMonitoring()`
  - `HasAdminPrivileges()`
  - `ForceDisableAllKioskFeatures()`

### 3. **Missing Member Variables** ✅
- **Problem**: Private member variables were referenced but not declared
- **Fix**: Moved to static global variables for proper state management:
  - `g_taskbar_hwnd` - Handle to taskbar window
  - `g_taskbar_hidden` - Taskbar visibility state
  - `g_kiosk_mode_active` - Kiosk mode status
  - `g_keyboard_hook` - Low-level keyboard hook
  - `g_monitor_thread` - Process monitoring thread
  - `g_monitoring_active` - Monitoring state flag

### 4. **Plugin Registration API** ✅
- **Problem**: Incompatible API call in `custom_plugin_registrant.cpp`
- **Fix**: Updated to use proper Flutter Windows API:
  ```cpp
  auto registrar = std::make_unique<flutter::PluginRegistrarWindows>(engine);
  windows_kiosk::WindowsKioskPlugin::RegisterWithRegistrar(registrar.get());
  ```

### 5. **Missing Header Declarations** ✅
- **Problem**: Methods were called but not declared in header
- **Fix**: Added all missing method declarations to `windows_kiosk_plugin.h`

### 6. **Missing Includes** ✅
- **Problem**: Missing threading and timing headers
- **Fix**: Added required includes:
  - `#include <thread>`
  - `#include <chrono>`

## Key Implementation Details

### Global State Management
- Uses static global variables for cross-function state sharing
- Thread-safe design with proper cleanup in destructor

### Low-Level Keyboard Hook
- Implements `LowLevelKeyboardProc` to block Windows key, Alt+Tab, etc.
- Handles Ctrl+Alt+Del blocking
- Returns 1 to block keys, calls `CallNextHookEx` to pass through

### Process Monitoring
- Background thread monitors for Task Manager and other unwanted processes
- Automatically terminates blocked processes
- Clean thread management with proper join/cleanup

### Registry Operations
- Helper functions for setting/deleting registry values
- Proper HKEY management with cleanup
- Targets user-level policies for Task Manager control

### Plugin Registration
- Uses proper Flutter Windows plugin architecture
- Method channel setup with proper callback handling
- Comprehensive method routing for all kiosk operations

## Current Status ✅

The Windows kiosk plugin should now compile successfully with:
- ✅ No class redefinition errors
- ✅ All methods properly implemented
- ✅ All member variables resolved
- ✅ Proper plugin registration
- ✅ Complete header/implementation alignment
- ✅ Thread-safe design
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup

## Testing
To verify the fixes:
1. Run `flutter clean`
2. Run `flutter build windows --debug`
3. Should compile without C++ errors
4. Plugin should be properly registered and functional

The Windows kiosk mode should now be fully functional when toggled from the settings view.
