# WebView Duplicate Loading: Complete Fix

## Problem

WebView tiles were being loaded twice when opened via MQTT `open_browser` commands, causing:
1. Duplicate network requests
2. Increased memory usage
3. Visible flickering during page loading

## Root Causes

1. **Inconsistent WebView creation**: WebView widgets were recreated with new keys on each rebuild
2. **Aggressive WebView refreshing**: WebView was refreshed unnecessarily in didUpdateWidget
3. **URL caching issues**: WebViewManager had inconsistent URL normalization
4. **Widget tree rebuilds**: The Flutter widget tree was rebuilding the WebView controllers

## Complete Solution

### 1. WebViewManager Improvements
- Added URL normalization for consistent caching
- Improved WebView data storage and retrieval

### 2. TilingWindowView Optimization
- Added stable keys to WebViewTile creation

### 3. WebViewTile Preservation
- Maintained a stable WebView instance that doesn't get recreated on widget rebuilds
- Improved didUpdateWidget logic to prevent unnecessary resets
- Preserved the WebViewController across widget tree rebuilds using a stable ValueKey

### 4. Added Comprehensive Debug Logging
- Added detailed logs with üîß emoji for tracking WebView creation
- Added error handling with ‚ö†Ô∏è emoji for easier debugging

## Testing

To verify the fix, load a WebView tile and observe that:
1. The WebView controllers are not deallocated and recreated during widget tree rebuilds
2. No duplicate page loads occur
3. The URL is loaded only once
4. The WebView state remains intact when other parts of the UI update

## Additional Benefits

- Improved memory usage by preventing unnecessary WebView recreation
- Eliminated visual flickering during WebView refreshes
- Reduced network usage by preventing duplicate page loads

## Technical Implementation

The key components of the fix:
1. Used a stable ValueKey based on windowId for the WebView
2. Created a single WebView instance per URL + windowId combination
3. Improved WebViewManager's URL normalization
4. Enhanced logging for better debugging

This fix maintains the WebView instance even when the widget tree rebuilds, preventing the deallocation and recreation of WebView controllers.
