# Flutter GetX Kiosk Application Fixes

This document describes the fixes implemented for the Flutter GetX Kiosk application.

## WebView Implementation

The application now uses `flutter_inappwebview` for reliable web content display across platforms.

### Fixes Implemented:

1. Replaced placeholder WebView with a proper implementation using `flutter_inappwebview` (v6.1.5)
2. Created a robust WebViewTile component with full error handling
3. Added loading indicators and proper error states
4. Fixed the "opaque is not implemented on macOS" error by using a WebView implementation compatible with macOS

## Video/Audio Playback

The media playback has been simplified to use MediaKit's built-in controls.

### Fixes Implemented:

1. Simplified MediaTile component to use MediaKit's AdaptiveVideoControls
2. Updated AudioTile to use MediaKit's MaterialDesktopVideoControls for better audio visualization
3. Removed unnecessary custom controls to rely on MediaKit's native implementation
4. Fixed error handling and loading states

## General Improvements

1. Updated dependencies in pubspec.yaml to use the correct versions
2. Created a run.sh script to properly clean and rebuild the application
3. Fixed various state management issues

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
