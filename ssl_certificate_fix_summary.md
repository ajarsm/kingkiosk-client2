# SSL Certificate Handling Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
We successfully fixed the SSL certificate handling and error management in both WebViewTile and YouTubePlayerTile components. The following issues were resolved:

1. Removed unsupported `allowsInsecureConnections: true` parameter from WebViewTile
2. Removed references to non-existent enum values:
   - `WebResourceErrorType.CONNECT`
   - `WebResourceErrorType.INTERNET_DISCONNECTED`
3. Confirmed proper implementation of SSL certificate handlers in both components:
   ```dart
   onReceivedServerTrustAuthRequest: (controller, challenge) async {
     return ServerTrustAuthResponse(action: ServerTrustAuthResponseAction.PROCEED);
   }
   ```
4. Verified that the code now compiles without errors and handles SSL certificate issues gracefully

## Verification
- Created verification script to check all necessary changes were made
- Updated the test script to include comprehensive checks
- All verification checks now pass

## Implementation Approach
Instead of using the unsupported `allowsInsecureConnections` parameter, we implemented the proper SSL certificate handler using the `onReceivedServerTrustAuthRequest` callback. This ensures that SSL certificate errors are handled gracefully, and the WebView can proceed loading pages even with self-signed or invalid certificates.

## Documentation
A comprehensive documentation file (`webview_ssl_certificate_handling.md`) was created to explain the changes, implementation approach, and future considerations for SSL certificate handling.

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider implementing actual certificate validation for security-critical applications
2. Enhance the error UI to provide more detailed information about certificate errors
3. Review WebResourceErrorType values when updating the package in the future
