# Media Control Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of enhanced media controls and background audio preservation for the KingKiosk application.

## Implemented Features

### 1. MediaControlService
A new service that provides methods for controlling media playback:

- **Window-specific media controls**:
  - `playMedia(windowId)`: Play/resume media in a specific window
  - `pauseMedia(windowId)`: Pause media in a specific window
  - `stopMedia(windowId)`: Stop media in a specific window
  - `seekMedia(windowId, position)`: Seek to a position in media

- **Background audio controls**:
  - `playBackgroundAudio()`: Play/resume background audio
  - `pauseBackgroundAudio()`: Pause background audio
  - `stopBackgroundAudio()`: Stop background audio
  - `seekBackgroundAudio(position)`: Seek to a position in background audio

### 2. Enhanced MediaRecoveryService
The MediaRecoveryService has been enhanced to properly handle background audio during media resets:

- `captureBackgroundAudioState()`: Captures the current state of background audio
- `restoreBackgroundAudio()`: Restores background audio to its previous state

### 3. MQTT Command Handlers
New MQTT commands have been implemented:

- **Background audio commands**:
  - `play_audio`: Play/resume background audio
  - `pause_audio`: Pause background audio
  - `stop_audio`: Stop background audio
  - `seek_audio`: Seek to a position in background audio (requires `position` parameter)

- **Reset media enhancement**:
  - The `reset_media` command now preserves background audio during reset operations

### 4. Documentation
The MQTT reference documentation has been updated to include:

- New background audio control commands
- Enhanced description of reset_media to mention background audio preservation
- New media seek commands for both window-specific and background audio
- Updated examples for all new commands

## Testing

A test script (`test_media_controls.sh`) has been provided to verify the functionality of:

1. Background audio controls (play, pause, stop, seek)
2. Window-specific media controls (play, pause, stop, seek)
3. Background audio preservation during media reset

### How to Run Tests

1. Ensure that mosquitto_pub is installed on your system
2. Edit the test script to set the correct MQTT broker details and device name
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./test_media_controls.sh
   ```

### Expected Results

- All background audio controls should work as expected
- All window-specific media controls should work as expected
- Background audio should continue playing after a media reset
- The media reset status report should include background audio information

## Next Steps

1. Complete testing on all platforms (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux)
2. Consider implementing volume control specific to background audio
3. Enhance error handling and reporting for media control operations
4. Add additional background audio controls (e.g., loop toggle, fade effects)
