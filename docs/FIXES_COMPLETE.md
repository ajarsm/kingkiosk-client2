# Completed Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes applied to the Flutter GetX Kiosk application.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. MQTT Service Error
- Replaced `_client!.connectionStatus!.reasonCode` with `_client!.connectionStatus!.state.toString()` in mqtt_service_consolidated.dart
- Fixed error "reasoncode is not defined" that was causing connection errors

### 2. Theme Service Issues
- Updated settings_controller.dart to use GetX's built-in `Get.changeThemeMode()` instead of nonexistent `_themeService.setThemeMode()`
- Removed unnecessary imports and fields

### 3. References to Consolidated Files
- Updated MqttServiceFixed references to MqttService in app_lifecycle_service.dart and device_test_controller.dart
- Fixed connect method calls with named parameters (`brokerUrl` and `port`)

### 4. NavigationService Registration
- Added NavigationService to the InitialBinding class to properly register it for dependency injection
- Fixed the error "NavigationService not found" when clicking the settings icon

### 5. RenderFlex Overflow Issues
- Made the toolbar scrollable horizontally with SingleChildScrollView to prevent overflow on smaller screens
- Fixed the _AutoHidingToolbar to prevent overflow in minimized state by:
  - Using Align instead of nested Center/Column widgets
  - Adding strict height constraints to toolbar components
  - Setting a fixed height container for toolbar buttons
- Optimized the toolbar buttons to use less vertical space and handle text overflow

### 6. Unused Files Cleanup
- Created and ran cleanup_unused_files.sh to remove 10 unused files
- Created CODE_CLEANUP_REPORT.md documenting the cleanup process

### 7. HomeController Updates
- Added missing `closeMaximizedWebView()` method to HomeController
- Added `isWebViewMaximized` observable to track web view state

### 8. Home View Restoration
- Added TilingWindowController to HomeBinding for the tiling window functionality
- Updated app_pages_fixed.dart to use TilingWindowView as the main home view
- Fixed missing binding dependencies
