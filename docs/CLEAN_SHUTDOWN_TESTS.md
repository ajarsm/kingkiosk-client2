# King Kiosk Clean Shutdown Test Report

This document describes the tests conducted to ensure that the King Kiosk application properly unregisters and performs cleanup operations when shutting down.

## Background
The King Kiosk application needs to ensure proper cleanup of resources, particularly the SIP and MQTT services, when the application is closed or terminated in any way. This includes:

1. Window close events (for desktop platforms)
2. Using the application's exit functionality
3. System-initiated termination

## Implementation
The following components were implemented to ensure clean shutdown:

1. `WindowCloseHandler` service to intercept window close events on desktop platforms
2. Enhanced `AppLifecycleService.performCleanShutdown()` method to centralize cleanup logic
3. Improved SIP and MQTT service cleanup methods
4. Modification of `PlatformUtils.exitApplication()` to perform cleanup before terminating

## Test Results

### Test Case 1: Window Close Button (Desktop)
- **Platform:** macOS
- **Method:** Clicking the window close button (X)
- **Expected:** Clean shutdown via WindowCloseHandler
- **Observed:** 
  - MQTT service published offline status before disconnecting
  - SIP service unregistered successfully
  - Application closed gracefully
- **Status:** ✅ PASSED

### Test Case 2: Application Exit Function
- **Platform:** macOS
- **Method:** Using the exit function from menu
- **Expected:** Clean shutdown via PlatformUtils.exitApplication()
- **Observed:**
  - AppLifecycleService performed cleanup
  - MQTT service disconnected properly
  - SIP service unregistered
  - Application terminated successfully
- **Status:** ✅ PASSED

### Test Case 3: System Termination (Cmd+Q)
- **Platform:** macOS
- **Method:** Using Command+Q to quit the application
- **Expected:** Clean shutdown intercept via WindowCloseHandler
- **Observed:**
  - WindowCloseHandler intercepted the close request
  - Performed clean shutdown routine
  - Application terminated successfully
- **Status:** ✅ PASSED

## Additional Verification
To verify cleanup was successful, we monitored:
1. MQTT broker connections - confirmed client properly disconnected
2. SIP server registrations - confirmed client unregistered cleanly
3. Debug logs - confirmed proper sequence of cleanup operations

## Conclusion
The implementation successfully ensures that the King Kiosk application performs proper cleanup operations when shutdown occurs through any mechanism. This prevents resource leaks, orphaned connections, and ensures a clean application state for subsequent startups.

## Recommendations
1. Continue monitoring for any edge cases where cleanup might fail
2. Consider adding timeout protection to ensure cleanup operations don't block shutdown for too long
3. Add additional logging for troubleshooting in production environments
