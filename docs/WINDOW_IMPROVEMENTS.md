# Window Management Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the window management system in the Flutter GetX Kiosk application.

## Enhanced Resize & Drag Support

The window management system has been enhanced to provide better support for both mouse and touch input devices. These improvements make the application more accessible and user-friendly across different platforms.

### New Components

1. **DraggableWindowWidget**
   - A reusable widget that encapsulates the window behavior
   - Provides consistent resizing and dragging behavior
   - Properly separates concerns with clear callbacks

### Key Improvements

#### Mouse Support
- Added proper cursor feedback (resize cursors when hovering over resize areas)
- Implemented specific resize handlers for different edges (right, bottom, corner)
- Used MouseRegion for visual feedback

#### Touch Support
- Increased touch target sizes for easier interaction on touch screens
- Implemented multi-directional drag handlers
- Used GestureDetector with proper constraints to ensure smooth resizing

#### Visual Improvements
- Added consistent visual feedback for selected windows
- Improved the drag handle appearance
- Better separation of draggable title bar and resizable edges

### Technical Implementation

The implementation uses:
- Flutter's GestureDetector for touch input
- MouseRegion for cursor feedback on desktop
- Positioned widgets for absolute positioning
- Custom StatefulWidget for maintaining resize state

### Usage

The window system now supports:
1. Dragging windows by their title bar
2. Resizing from any edge (right, bottom)
3. Resizing from the corner
4. Minimum size constraints to prevent windows from becoming too small

### Cross-Platform Testing

The improved window management system has been tested on:
- Desktop (mouse input)
- Touch devices (direct touch input)
- Different screen sizes

### Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements could include:
- Snapping windows to edges/other windows
- Maximizing/minimizing windows
- Window grouping
- Better handling of window stacking order
