# Batch Commands Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

The batch commands feature has been successfully implemented in the King Kiosk client application. This feature allows sending multiple commands at once via a single MQTT message, which makes it easier to orchestrate complex actions and reduces network traffic.

## Files Modified

1. `/lib/app/services/mqtt_service_consolidated.dart`
   - Added batch command processing capability in the `_processCommand` method
   - Implemented recursive command processing for batch items

## Files Created

1. `/test_batch_commands.sh`
   - Test script to demonstrate batch command functionality
   - Includes examples of sending multiple window creation commands at once

2. `/docs/BATCH_COMMANDS.md`
   - Documentation for the batch commands feature
   - Includes format details, examples, and usage information

## How It Works

Batch commands are sent as a JSON object with a `commands` array containing multiple command objects:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "command": "command1",
      ...command1 parameters...
    },
    {
      "command": "command2",
      ...command2 parameters...
    }
  ]
}
```

When the MQTT service receives a message with a `commands` array, it:
1. Processes each command in the array sequentially
2. Handles errors independently for each command
3. Continues processing remaining commands even if some fail

## Benefits

- Create complex screen layouts with a single API call
- Reduce network traffic by batching operations
- Simplify client-side implementations
- Enable orchestration of related commands

## Testing

The feature can be tested using the provided test script:

```bash
./test_batch_commands.sh
```

This will demonstrate creating multiple windows with different content types in a single API call.
