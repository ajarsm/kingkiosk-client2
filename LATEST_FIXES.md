# Latest Fixes in Flutter GetX Kiosk

## New Features

### System Information Dashboard
- Added System Information button to the toolbar
- Shows comprehensive system information in a dialog
- Added compact system stats (CPU & Memory usage) directly in toolbar
- Uses GetX reactive state for real-time updates

## UI Issues Fixed

### 1. RenderFlex Overflow
- Fixed the overflow in the auto-hiding toolbar that was causing yellow/black striped warnings
- Replaced Container with SizedBox and DecoratedBox combo for better constraints handling

### 2. Window Maximization
- Added a maximize button for windows in floating mode
- Implemented maximizeTile() method in TilingWindowController
- Windows can now be maximized to fill the available screen space

### 3. Tooltips for Window Controls
- Added tooltips to all window control buttons for better usability
- "Split Horizontally (Left/Right)" and "Split Vertically (Top/Bottom)" for split controls
- "Maximize Window" for maximize button
- "Close Window" for close button

### 4. Full Height Utilization
- Fixed the issue where windows weren't using the full height in tiling mode
- Changed container bounds to use the entire screen height
- Auto-hiding toolbar now properly overlays without affecting the layout
- Reduced the peek height of the hidden toolbar from 10px to 5px for better aesthetics

## Technical Implementation

### Container Bounds
The container bounds now include the full screen height:
```dart
controller.setContainerBounds(Rect.fromLTWH(
  0, 0, context.width, context.height
));
```

### Maximize Function
Added maximize functionality to fill available space:
```dart
void maximizeTile(WindowTile tile) {
  if (!tilingMode.value) {
    // Use available container bounds
    final margin = 5.0;
    tile.position = Offset(margin, margin);
    tile.size = Size(
      _containerBounds.width - 2 * margin,
      _containerBounds.height - 2 * margin,
    );
  }
}
```

### Tooltips
Added tooltips to improve usability:
```dart
Tooltip(
  message: "Split Horizontally (Left/Right)",
  child: IconButton(...)
)
```

These changes significantly improve the user experience by making the interface more intuitive and fixing visual issues.
