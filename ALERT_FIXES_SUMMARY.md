# Alert System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Double Dialog Problem
**Issue**: AlertDialogWidget was wrapping content in a Dialog widget, causing two dialogs to appear.
**Solution**: Removed the Dialog wrapper from AlertDialogWidget, now returns Container directly.

### 2. Positioning Not Working  
**Issue**: Dialog widget was forcing center alignment, preventing custom positioning.
**Solution**: AlertDialogWidget now returns a plain Container that can be positioned by the parent Stack.

### 3. Syntax Errors in AlertDialogWidget
**Issue**: File had multiple syntax errors (missing line breaks, malformed structure).
**Solution**: Completely recreated the file with proper syntax and structure.

### 4. Import and Analysis Errors
**Issue**: Dart analyzer was reporting AlertDialogWidget as undefined due to cached compilation errors.
**Solution**: Ran `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get` to clear cached analysis.

## Current Status

✅ **AlertDialogWidget**: Now properly structured without Dialog wrapper
✅ **AlertService**: Uses Stack and Positioned widgets for 9-position placement
✅ **Syntax Errors**: All compilation errors resolved
✅ **Import Issues**: Alert service properly imports and uses AlertDialogWidget
✅ **Border Controls**: Optional borders with customizable colors
✅ **MQTT Integration**: Enhanced with position, border, and color parameters

## Testing

- Created `test_simple_alert.bat` for basic MQTT testing
- All previous positioning test scripts available
- Build in progress for full application testing
