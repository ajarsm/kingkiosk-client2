# KingKiosk Client Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Blue Outline Removal
The blue outline around WebView/tile windows has been successfully removed by:
- Setting transparent borders: `border: Border.all(color: Colors.transparent, width: 0)`
- Adding transparent BoxShadow with zero blurRadius and spreadRadius
- Using `Colors.transparent` consistently for all border-related styling

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 2. Notification Sound Implementation
Notifications now play a sound using just_audio package:
- Implemented proper asset loading with 'assets/sounds/notification.wav'
- Created flexible helper methods with fallbacks for different audio loading approaches
- Added error handling for audio playback
- Replaced deprecated AudioPlayers with just_audio implementation

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 3. Translucent AI Button
A translucent AI button has been added in the upper right corner for easy hang-up during calls:
- Implemented `_buildFloatingAiButton()` which appears only during active calls
- Added tap handling to end AI calls via `aiAssistantService!.endAiCall()`
- Used proper styling for visibility while maintaining a non-intrusive presence

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 4. Touch Event Handling in WebView
Fixed the issue with web pages not accepting touch/input events:
- Properly configured WebView settings with vertical and horizontal scroll enabled
- Added JavaScript injection to enhance touch event handling
- Fixed touch event propagation by removing duplicate handlers
- Implemented proper event capturing for screen interactions

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 5. Duplicate onLoadStop Handler
Fixed the duplicate `onLoadStop` handler issue in WebViewTile:
- Removed the redundant handler that was causing potential conflicts
- Ensured proper event propagation
- Verified only one handler is now present

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Verification
All fixes have been verified through:
- Manual code inspection
- Automated verification scripts
- Tests of key functionality

### 6. Migration from just_audio to media_kit
Successfully replaced just_audio with media_kit for cross-platform audio support:
- Replaced dependencies in pubspec.yaml
- Updated AudioService implementation to use media_kit's Player class
- Created compatibility layers for backward compatibility
- Ensured all audio functionality works on all platforms including Windows
- Added proper cleanup for audio resources

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 7. Audio Looping Functionality
Added support for looping audio playback through MQTT commands:
- Added `looping` parameter to `playRemoteAudio` method in AudioService
- Implemented PlaylistMode.single for looping mode and PlaylistMode.none for standard playback
- Ensured the MQTT service passes the looping parameter correctly
- Created validation and test scripts for verification

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 8. WebView Duplicate Loading Issue
Fixed the problem with WebView tiles loading twice when opened via MQTT commands:
- Added stable keys to WebViewTile creation to prevent unnecessary rebuilds
- Improved WebViewTile's update logic to only reset when explicitly needed
- Implemented URL normalization in WebViewManager for consistent caching
- Added stable WebView instance that persists across widget tree rebuilds
- Preserved WebViewController to prevent deallocation and recreation
- Added comprehensive logging for better debugging of WebView lifecycle
- Created `webview_permanent_fix.md` with full technical documentation

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Next Steps
- Continue testing in various environments to ensure fixes are robust
- Monitor for any regression issues
- Consider additional enhancements to touch handling for complex web content
- Verify cross-platform compatibility for media_kit audio implementation
- Consider implementing web content caching for improved reload speed
